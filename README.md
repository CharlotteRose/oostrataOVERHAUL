We (myself and the cactupus) are glad your here. Thanks to the inspirational materials bequeathed to us by one J.R.R Tolkein I am creating "One Operating System to Rule Them All". Well, that's the goal. I will minimize time consumption and make the introduction to OO.STR.TA shorter than a machiatto doppio, and sweeter than butterfinger blizzard.

<h1>The short and sweet.</h1> 
Oostra is a command line styled Operating Systems simulator. Due to budgetary constraits, this simulator will lack every single bell and whistle imaginable. That's right. EVERY. SINGLE. BELL(*and whistle). We know that the world today is full of noise and commotion. Oostra takes you back to a simpler time. With this simulator, you will usher in an era reminiscent of the stone age. No need to worry about calendars or events. Forget about being bothered by updates or notifications. Oostra specializes in the art minimalism. In our world you can ignore your inner critic, and just appreicate the simple things in life. If you are looking for a reliably bare boned operating system look no further. Oostra is your answer.
