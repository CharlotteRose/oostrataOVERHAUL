We (myself and the cactupus) are glad your here. Thanks to the inspirational materials bequeathed to us by one J.R.R Tolkein I am creating "One Operating System to Rule Them All". Well, that's the goal. Despite the almost certain probability that I will fail to meet that goal I will minimize time consumption and make the introduction to OO.STR.TA shorter than a machiatto doppio, and sweeter than butterfinger blizzard.

<h1>The short and sweet.</h1> 
Oostra is a command line styled Operating Systems simulator. Due to budgetary constraits (ps. budgets make the perfect scapegoat) this simulator will lack every single bell and whistle imaginable. That's right. EVERY. SINGLE. BELL(*and whistle). Oostra specializes in the art minimalism. In our world you can ignore your inner critic, set the lowest standards possible and still come out ahead. If you are looking for a reliably bare boned operating system look no further. Oostra is your answer.
